1.      Clone from your savi-lib repo into a subfolder of src:<br>
        git clone https://github.com/githubusername/savi-lib.git lib<br>
        where githubusername is your username on github<br>
        and the path give to clone is for your lib fork<br>
        NOTE: your lib subfolder of src needs to be named lib<br>
        If you failed to give the lib argument as target name, then rename the lib folder to lib
1.      cd lib
1.      Set the upstream master for lib:
        git remote add upstream https://github.com/ml5174/savi-lib.git

1.      git pull upstream master
1.      cd ../..

1.      git checkout master
1.      git pull upstream master
1.      Once you cloned the repo to your desktop and have node installed you need to cd to the project and type:<br>
        npm install
1.      Now install cordova and ionic. if on macOS, you may need to prefix this command with sudo:<br>
        npm install -g cordova ionic
